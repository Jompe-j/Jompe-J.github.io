# About me
When I was 18 years old I told myself that computers and programming was not a vocation but a hobby.  Some 15 years later I understod that you really should not take life advice from people that are 18 years old.

Now I am a tax lawyer studying to be a programmer so I guess it turned out ok. Happily married, without kids but with a cat I navigate life with a mixture of over planning and spur of the moment gut choices. As most people.

I love to sail, learn new stuff, lift heavy objects and climb up walls. I drink just the right amount of coffee and coke to be a programmer (i.e. a lot) and have the handwriting of a drunk doctor (i.e. very bad).
