## DISCUS
I added disqus-comments to my blog posts. It was quite straight forward and disqus has quite a simple step by step guide to follow. The only real issue was some of the liquid templates provided by disqus for the configuration variables. Someone on slack found a solution and with a simple change to page.url everything worked pretty much out of the box.   

To enable comments on a blog post I only have to put  comment: true in the YAML front matter of the markdown file of my posts.
