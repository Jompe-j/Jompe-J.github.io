# CSS pre-processors

CSS och CSS pre-processors

- What do I think of pre-compiling your CSS?

As a fan of organizing stuff, the use of mixins, nesting and variables were a positive experience. Of course if a project is small enough the added time it takes to organize the code might not be worth it. Also the added complexity of using the pre-compiler must be considered.  
* Compare to regular CSS
  * Being able to nest the SCSS (wholly preffer the SCSS-syntax compared to Sass) was fantastic revelation. 
* Which techniques did you use?
  * As I mainly eddited the minima-theme I changed/used some nesting and variables. The mixins are greate but didnt need to change what I wanted to achive.
* Pros and cons?
  * Well as with all organization of information you need to know how you want to order it (or how it's order). When I started to look in to the SCSS of minima-theme I hade to get a grip of how it was organized and that will be the case for anyone comming in to anay orgainized information. However when talking about code the program usually put more demands on how the informaiton (code) is organized and if the programmer does not follow those rules the code will not work. When looking att Sass there are very few rules and and the freedom to organize is big. Therefore it is hard to know how what the thoughtprocess behind each scss-file was.
